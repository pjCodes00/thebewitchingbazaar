This project is a custom-built e-commerce web app that includes an interactive in-browser game. It was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and the Phaser.js game framework.

I built this original project by applying everything I’ve learned from various tutorials on front-end development:HTML, CSS, JS and back-end development: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB. In addition to implementing core features, I created a custom tutorial user guide to help others understand how to use the app. Throughout the process, I also independently debugged issues and conducted my own research, which helped reinforce my skills in both frontend and backend technologies.

These are some of the resources I used to learn front-end development:
1.Front-end development(JavaScript, CSS and HTML):

2.Back-end development(Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB):

In this app, users can register and log in, with their details securely stored in a MongoDB database. After logging in, they can search for products using filters such as name, price, rating, shipping options, and featured status. Users can view product details, select specific variations, adjust quantities, and add items to their cart. Within the cart, users have the ability to increase or decrease item quantities or remove products entirely. They can then proceed to checkout and place an order, with the option to cancel orders under certain conditions.

This app uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authorization implemented with Node.js and Express.js to ensure secure user authentication and personalized access. Upon registration or login, each user is issued an access token, which grants them access to protected routes. This allows every user to have a personalized dashboard that displays only their own cart items and order history. All application data including products, cart contents, and orders is securely stored in a MongoDB database and accessed(fetched and displayed) through a backend API built with Node.js and Express.js.

Additionally, this e-commerce site features a built-in interactive game where users can cast spells. Players can choose a specific spell, prepare it through a multi-step process, and finally cast the spell in a unique final stage.

I've also created a step-by-step user tutorial to guide you through on how to use this app.

This project showcases fundamental concepts such as DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript, as well as backend integration, API-based data retrieval, JWT (JSON Web Token) authorization and data storage using MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js. This project also showcases game development using Phaser.js framework.

Technologies I Used to build this app include: 
  1.Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  2.Backend: Node.js, Express.js
  3.Database: MongoDB
  4.Game Engine: Phaser.js
